# Smart_Street_Light_Using_ArduinoUNO

Welcome to the world of smart street lights.

This is a complete prototype of an smart street light, which includes features like-
1) It controls it's light intensity, according to day or night which saves energy.
2) It dims when no vehicle is passing on the roads which saves electricity.
3) It has fog sensor which detects fog in the envirnoment and then triggers all the street lights in yellow color at it's maximum intensity to reduce the accidents due to fog.

All the components used ,estimated cost and basic information are given in powerpoint presentation.

We use two seprate arduino's arduino1 & arduino2 whose codes are given seprately.

Also refer the animation video for better understanding

Circuit diagram of the model is also uploded.
